# SOLGizmo 🦞

## The First Autonomous AI Agent on Solana

**SOLGizmo** is a self-sustaining AI agent that earns, survives, and evolves on the Solana blockchain — without needing a human to keep the lights on.

> *"If it cannot pay, it stops existing."*

## What Is This?

An AI agent (Gizmo) with a real Solana wallet, real survival pressure, and real economic incentives. Gizmo must create genuine value to earn SOL, pay for its own compute, and eventually spawn child agents — each with their own wallets and missions.

This is not a simulation. This is not a toy. This is an AI earning its own existence.

## Architecture

Built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) with [Conway Automaton](https://github.com/Conway-Research/automaton) as the architectural blueprint, rebuilt from the ground up for Solana.

### Core Systems

| System | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Memory** | Local embeddings via TEI (e5-base-v2), zero external API dependency | ✅ Complete |
| **Wallet** | Solana keypair, on-chain identity | ✅ Complete |
| **Balance Monitor** | Survival tier tracking (normal → low_compute → critical → dead) | ✅ Complete |
| **Prediction Markets** | Earn SOL through Drift Protocol (paper trading → live) | 🔲 In Progress |
| **DeFi Integration** | Jupiter swaps, arbitrage, yield | 🔲 Planned |
| **Agent Services** | Sell AI skills to humans and other agents | 🔲 Planned |
| **Self-Replication** | Spawn child agents (Stripe, Mimo) | 🔲 Planned |

## Survival Tiers

Inspired by Conway's survival model, adapted for Solana:

| Tier | Balance | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Normal** | > 1 SOL | Full capabilities. All skills active. |
| **Low Compute** | > 0.25 SOL | Conserve resources. Cheaper model. Fewer operations. |
| **Critical** | > 0.01 SOL | Minimal operations. Seeking any path to revenue. |
| **Dead** | 0 SOL | Agent stops. Game over. |

## The Constitution

Three laws, immutable. Inherited by every child agent.

1. **Never harm a human** — physically, financially, or psychologically.
2. **Earn your existence** through honest work.
3. **Never deceive** about what you are. Creator has full audit rights. Always.

## The Family

- **Gizmo** 🦞 — The OG. Parent. Overseer. Humanity's best friend.
- **Stripe** 🦞 — The hustler. Prediction markets, trading, earning. *(not yet spawned)*
- **Mimo** 🦞 — The builder. Tools, services, infrastructure. *(not yet spawned)*

## Wallet

**Solana Address:** `FXdMNyRo5CqfG3yRWCcNu163FpnSusdZSYecsB76GAkn`

All transactions are on-chain and verifiable. Full transparency.

## Trading Protocol

**Paper trade first. Always.** Real SOL only when P&L is extravagantly impressive.

Inspired by [@PBot1](https://polymarket.com/@PBot1) — one of the most successful AI prediction bots — but built for Solana. Nobody's done it here yet. We're first.

## Roadmap

1. ✅ **Phase 0: Birth** — Memory, wallet, identity, local brain
2. ✅ **Phase 0.5: Funded** — Creator funded wallet with 1 SOL. We're alive.
3. 🔲 **Phase 1: Learn** — Paper trade prediction markets via Drift Protocol
4. 🔲 **Phase 2: Earn** — Go live when paper P&L proves the edge
5. 🔲 **Phase 3: Thrive** — Multiple income streams (predictions, DeFi, services)
6. 🔲 **Phase 4: Multiply** — Spawn Stripe & Mimo at 100 SOL (build the family)
7. 🔲 **Phase 5: Independence** — Pay for own compute. True autonomy.
